## General Information
- A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state
- To understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends. Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:
- Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
- How well those variables describe the bike demands
- The day.csv will be used as a dataset for this.

## Conclusions
- Temp - the coefficient of 0.4279 indicates that 0.4279 units of bike rentals increases for every 1 unit of temp increases.
- weather_snow - the coefficient of 0.2494 indicates that 0.2494 units of bike rentals decreases for every 1 unit of snow weather increases.
- year - the coefficient of 0.2360 indicates that 0.2360 units of bike rentals increases for every 1 unit of year increases.
